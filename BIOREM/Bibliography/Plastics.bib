	Abstract = {Plastic wastes accumulating in the environment are posing an ever increasing ecological threat. In this context, an attempt was made to study the biodegradation of polyethylene films in the natural environment. The method suggested by ASTM standards, i.e. composting of polythene films with municipal solid waste, was adopted to examine the biodegradation of plastics in the natural environment. The samples were collected and tested for weight loss and reduction in tensile strength at 2 months interval for 12 months of composting. Loss of weight and reduction in tensile strength of polythene films were taken as the criteria indicating biodegradation of these materials. Composting of polythene films for 4 months did not show any degradation. After 4 months of composting, the loss in weight was 2.9-4.5{\%} for HDPE films and 10.5-11.6{\%} for LDPE films. Similarly, the reduction in tensile strength ranges from 16-20{\%} for HDPE and 12-13{\%} for LDPE films. The study indicates that the biodegradation of polythene films occur in natural environment at a very slower rate.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: Assessment of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-degrading bacteria isolated from plastic waste dumpsites of Gulf of Mannar. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rationally, 15 bacteria (GMB1-GMB15) were isolated by enrichment technique. GMB5 and GMB7 were selected for further studies based on their efficiency to degrade the HDPE and identified as Arthrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Assessed weight loss of HDPE after 30 days of incubation was nearly 12{\%} for Arthrobacter sp. and 15{\%} for Pseudomonas sp. The bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay showed that the cell surface hydrophobicity of Pseudomonas sp. was higher than Arthrobacter sp. Both fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and protein content of the biofilm were used to test the viability and protein density of the biomass. Acute peak elevation was observed between 2 and 5 days of inoculation for both bacteria. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum showed that keto carbonyl bond index (KCBI), Ester carbonyl bond index (ECBI) and Vinyl bond index (VBI) were increased indicating changes in functional group(s) and/or side chain modification confirming the biodegradation. CONCLUSION: The results pose us to suggest that both Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter sp. were proven efficient to degrade HDPE, albeit the former was more efficacious, yet the ability of latter cannot be neglected. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Recent alarm on ecological threats to marine system is dumping plastic waste in the marine ecosystem and coastal arena by anthropogenic activity. In maintenance phase of the plastic-derived polyethylene waste, the microbial degradation plays a major role; the information accomplished in this work will be the initiating point for the degradation of polyethylene by indigenous bacterial population in the marine ecosystem and provides a novel eco-friendly solution in eco-management.},

	Abstract = {The diversity and load of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi associated with the mangrove soil from Suva, Fiji Islands, was determined by using the plate count method. The ability of the bacterial isolates to produce various hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase, gelatinase and lipase were determined using the plate assay. The heterotrophic bacterial load was considerably higher than the fungal load. There was a predominance of the gram positive genus, Bacillus. Other genera encountered included Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Listeria and Vibrio. Their effectiveness on the degradation of commercial polythene carry bags made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied over a period of eight weeks in the laboratory. Biodegradation was measured in terms of mean weight loss, which was nearly 5 {\%} after a period of eight weeks. There was a significant increase in the bacterial load of the soil attached to class 2 (HDPE) polythene. After eight weeks of submergence in mangrove soil, soil attached to class 1 and class 3 polythene mostly had Bacillus (Staphylococcus predominated in class 2 polythene). While most of the isolates were capable of producing hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase and gelatinase, lipolytic activity was low. Class 2 HDPE suffered the greatest biodegradation.},

	Abstract = {Environmental threats restrict the use of nondegradable polymers and encourage the development and use of degradable plastics. In order to obtain a cost-effective biodegradable plastic, starch-filled polyethylene (PE) is still the best alternative. Starch and PE blend is incompatible at the molecular level and often leads to poor performance. In order to overcome this drawback, either PE or starch should be modified. The aim of this study was to modified linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and blend it with starch. Maleic anhydride (MA) was grafted onto LLDPE in xylene using dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as an initiator. Corn starch in varying concentrations (between 10 and 60{\%}) was blended with MA-g-LLDPE in a torque rheometer. The same blend compositions of nonfunctional LLDPE with the starch were prepared for comparative studies. The torque and totalized torque generated during blending are reported as a function of starch content. Torque decreased with increasing starch content for the compositions from 10 to 50{\%} and increased for 60{\%} starch content. Work energy decreased for all the compositions of blends except for 60{\%} starch content. Tensile strength and modulus increased and percentage elongation decreased as the starch content increased in the blends. Water absorption of the blends increased with an increase in starch content. The biodegradability of MA-g-LLDPE/starch blends have been studied in two biotic environments: (1) soil environment over a period of 6 months; (2) mixed fungi inoculum (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium funiculosum, Chaetomium globosum, Gliocladium virens and Pullularia pullulans) for 28 days. The samples containing more than 30{\%} starch content supported heavy fungus growth. Blends exposed to a soil environment degraded more than in fungi alone. Any changes in the various properties of the MA-g-LLDPE/starch before and after degradation were monitored using FTIR spectroscopy, weight loss, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for surface morphology, a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) for crystallinity and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) for rapid determination of starch content. Percentage crystallinity decreased as the starch content increased and biodegradation resulted in an increase of crystallinity in MA-g-LLDPE/starch blends.},

	Abstract = {During the past 50 years new plastic materials, in various applications, have gradually replaced the traditional metal, wood, leather materials. Ironically, the most preferred property of plastics - durability - exerts also the major environmental threat. Recycling has practically failed to provide a safe solution for disposal of plastic waste (only 5{\%} out of 1 trillion plastic bags, annually produced in the US alone, are being recycled). Since the most utilized plastic is polyethylene (PE; ca. 140 million tons/year), any reduction in the accumulation of PE waste alone would have a major impact on the overall reduction of the plastic waste in the environment. Since PE is considered to be practically inert, efforts were made to isolate unique microorganisms capable of utilizing synthetic polymers. Recent data showed that biodegradation of plastic waste with selected microbial strains became a viable solution. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The biodegradation of several polymers that had been buried under soil for over 32 years was examined. No evidence of biodegradation was found for polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and urea formaldehyde resin. A remarkable degradation was indicated for low density polyethylene thin films which were directly in contact with soil. Severely degraded parts of the film is characterized by whitening. Many small holes were recognized on the surface of the whitened part. The whitened part is specific for the growth of hyphae. FT-IR spectra of the whitened part showed a characteristic band in the vicinity of 1640 cm1 which was assigned to the stretching vibration of CC bond. Although the part which was not in contact with soil was clear, it also showed evidence of degradation from the presence of carbonyl band in FT-IR. It was suggested that the degradation of the clear part is due to the usual thermo-oxidative process, while the degradation of the whitened part is due to the biotic process. 1995 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

@article{Konduri2011,
	Abstract = {Proxidant additives represent a promising solution to the problem of the environment contamination with polyethylene film litter. Pro-oxidants accelerate photo- and thermo-oxidation and consequent polymer chain cleavage rendering the product apparently more susceptible to biodegradation. In the present study, fungal strain, Aspergillus oryzae isolated from HDPE film (buried in soil for 3 months) utilized abiotically treated polyethylene (LDPE) as a sole carbon source and degraded it. Treatment with pro-oxidant, manganese stearate followed by UV irradiation and incubation with A. oryzae resulted in maximum decrease in percentage of elongation and tensile strength by 62 and 51{\%}, respectively, compared with other pro-oxidant treated LDPE films which showed 45{\%} (titanium stearate), 40{\%} (iron stearate), and 39{\%} (cobalt stearate) decrease in tensile strength. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of proxidant treated LDPE films revealed generation of more number of carbonyl and carboxylic groups (1630-1840 cm(-1) and 1220-1340 cm(-1)) compared with UV treated film. When these films were incubated with A. oryzae for 3 months complete degradation of carbonyl and carboxylic groups was achieved. Scanning electron microscopy of untreated and treated LDPE films also revealed that polymer has undergone degradation after abiotic and biotic treatments. This concludes proxidant treatment before UV irradiation accelerated photo-oxidation of LDPE, caused functional groups to be generated in the polyethylene film and this resulted in biodegradation due to the consumption of carbonyl and carboxylic groups by A. oryzae which was evident by reduction in carbonyl peaks. Among the pro-oxidants, manganese stearate treatment caused maximum degradation of polyethylene. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 120: 3536-3545, 2011},

	Abstract = {Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is one of the most widely applied techniques for the investigation of cultural heritage materials. FTIR microscopy is well established as an essential tool in the microdestructive analysis of small samples, and the recent introduction of mapping and imaging equipment allows the collection of a large number of FTIR spectra on a surface, providing a distribution map of identified compounds. In this Account, we report recent advances in FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy in our research group. Our laboratory develops, tests, and refines new and less-studied IR spectroscopy and microscopy methods, with the goal of their adoption as routine analytical techniques in conservation laboratories. We discuss (i) the analysis of inorganic materials inactive in the mid-IR region by means of far-IR spectroscopy, (ii) the development of new methods for preparing cross sections, (iii) the characterization and spatial location of thin layers and small particles, and (iv) the evaluation of protective treatments. FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy have been mostly used in the mid-IR region of 4000-600 cm(-1). Some inorganic pigments, however, are inactive in this region, so other spectroscopic techniques have been applied, such as Raman spectroscopy. We suggest an alternative: harnessing the far-IR (600-50 cm(-1)). Our initial results show that far-IR spectroscopy is exceptionally useful with mural paintings or with corrosion products from which larger sample quantities can generally be collected. Moreover, the inorganic composition of a sample can be characterized by the presence of several compounds that are inactive in the mid-IR range (such as sulfides, oxides, and so forth). Stratigraphical analyses by FTIR microscopy can be hindered by the process of cross section preparation, which often involves an embedding organic polymer penetrating the sample's porous structure. Here, the polymer bands may completely cover the bands of organic compounds in the sample. However, a correct methodological approach can prevent such limitations. For example, it is always advisable to analyze the sample surface before preparing the cross section in order to characterize the preparation layers and the varnish layers, which are generally applied to the surface of a painting both to protect it and improve the color saturation. Furthermore, the innovative use of IR-transparent salts as embedding material for cross sections can prevent contamination of the embedding resin and improve detection of organic substances. Another key point in the use of FTIR microscopy in artwork analysis is spatial resolution. The high-energy output of a new integrated FTIR microscope enhances the ability to characterize and spatially locate small particles and thin layers. Moreover, the new configuration proves extremely useful in the evaluation of protective treatments, because larger areas may be analyzed in less time in comparison to traditional systems, allowing the collection of more statistical data.},

Degradation of LDPE was determined by weight loss of the sample, morphological changes, mechanical and spectroscopic variations. The eluted compounds after degradation were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. Our results show that Pseudomonas spp. can degrade LDPE films.},

	Abstract = {Lignin is the most abundant renewable source of aromatic polymer in nature, and its decomposition is indispensable for carbon recycling. It is chemically recalcitrant to breakdown by most organisms because of the complex, heterogeneous structure. The white-rot fungi produce an array of extracellular oxidative enzymes that synergistically and efficiently degrade lignin. The major groups of ligninolytic enzymes include lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, versatile peroxidases, and laccases. The peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes with catalytic cycles that involve the activation by H2O2 and substrate reduction of compound I and compound II intermediates. Lignin peroxidases have the unique ability to catalyze oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds and ether (C-O-C) bonds in non-phenolic aromatic substrates of high redox potential. Manganese peroxidases oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III), which facilitates the degradation of phenolic compounds or, in turn, oxidizes a second mediator for the breakdown of non-phenolic compounds. Versatile peroxidases are hybrids of lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase with a bifunctional characteristic. Laccases are multi-copper-containing proteins that catalyze the oxidation of phenolic substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. This review covers the chemical nature of lignin substrates and focuses on the biochemical properties, molecular structures, reaction mechanisms, and related structures/functions of these enzymes.},

	Abstract = {Laccase is one of the few enzymes that have been the subject of study since the end of the last century. The enzyme is a type of copper-containing polyphenol oxidase that was discovered in the exudates of the Japanese lacquer tree Rhus verniczfera (Yoshida, 1883) and sub- sequently was demonstrated as a fungal enzyme as well (Bertrand, 1896; Laborde, 1896). At present, there is only one bacterium, A{\~{}}ospirillum lipoferum, in which a laccase- type phenol oxidase has been demonstrated (Givaudan et al., 1993). Laccase is one of a small group of enzymes called the large blue copper proteins or blue copper oxidases. The other members of this group are the plant ascorbate oxidases and the mammalian plasma protein ceruloplasmin. It has very recently been shown, in addition, that phenoxazinone synthase from Streptomjces antibioticus has several features in common with the blue oxidases (Freeman et a/., 1993).},

@article{Ferraroni2007,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laccases belong to multicopper oxidases, a widespread class of enzymes implicated in many oxidative functions in pathogenesis, immunogenesis and morphogenesis of organisms and in the metabolic turnover of complex organic substances. They catalyze the coupling between the four one-electron oxidations of a broad range of substrates with the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water. These catalytic processes are made possible by the contemporaneous presence of at least four copper ion sites, classified according to their spectroscopic properties: one type 1 (T1) site where the electrons from the reducing substrates are accepted, one type 2 (T2), and a coupled binuclear type 3 pair (T3) which are assembled in a T2/T3 trinuclear cluster where the electrons are transferred to perform the O2 reduction to H2O.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The structure of a laccase from the white-rot fungus Lentinus (Panus) tigrinus, a glycoenzyme involved in lignin biodegradation, was solved at 1.5 A. It reveals a asymmetric unit containing two laccase molecules (A and B). The progressive reduction of the copper ions centers obtained by the long-term exposure of the crystals to the high-intensity X-ray synchrotron beam radiation under aerobic conditions and high pH allowed us to detect two sequential intermediates in the molecular oxygen reduction pathway: the "peroxide" and the "native" intermediates, previously hypothesized through spectroscopic, kinetic and molecular mechanics studies. Specifically the electron-density maps revealed the presence of an end-on bridging, micro-eta 1:eta 1 peroxide ion between the two T3 coppers in molecule B, result of a two-electrons reduction, whereas in molecule A an oxo ion bridging the three coppers of the T2/T3 cluster (micro3-oxo bridge) together with an hydroxide ion externally bridging the two T3 copper ions, products of the four-electrons reduction of molecular oxygen, were best modelled.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This is the first structure of a multicopper oxidase which allowed the detection of two intermediates in the molecular oxygen reduction and splitting. The observed features allow to positively substantiate an accurate mechanism of dioxygen reduction catalyzed by multicopper oxidases providing general insights into the reductive cleavage of the O-O bonds, a leading problem in many areas of biology.},

Owing to their high non-specific oxidation capacity, laccases are useful biocatalysts for diverse biotechnological applications. Until recently, laccases were only found in eukaryotes (fungi, higher plants, insects), but now there is strong evidence for their widespread distribution in prokaryotes and the first crystal structure of a bacterial laccase is already available.

The chemical, enzymatic, and molecular aspects of the fungal attack of lignin, which represents the key step in wood decay, are also discussed. Modern analytical techniques to investigate fungal degradation and modification of the lignin polymer are reviewed, as are the different oxidative enzymes (oxidoreductases) involved in lignin degradation.

Special emphasis is given to the reactions catalyzed, their synergistic action on lignin, and the structural bases for their unique catalytic properties.

	Abstract = {The transformations of lignin that occur during its biodegradation are complex and incompletely understood. Certain fungi of the white-rot group, and possibly other fungi and bacteria, completely decompose lignin to carbon dioxide and water. Other fungi and bacteria apparently degrade lignin incompletely. Differences in lignin-degrading abilities observed for different organisms may result from differences in the completeness of their ligninolytic enzyme systems. Not all lignin components may be attacked by a particular organism. Alternatively, different organisms may differ in their basic mechanisms of attack on lignin. The basic pathways of lignin degradation have been elucidated only for certain representatives of the white-and brown-rot fungi. Although it is known that each of the principal structural components of lignin is attacked by other fungi and bacteria, the biochemistry of that attack has not been elucidated. Work with low molecular weight lignin models has provided only limited information on possible pathways of lignin degradation by microorganisms. There is little evidence to suggest a correlation between abilities to degrade single-ring aromatic or lignin model compounds and the ability to degrade polymeric lignin. More evidence has come from analysis of spent culture media for lignin breakdown products and from comparative chemical analyses of sound lignins versus decayed lignin residues. Accumulated evidence with the most thoroughly studied white-rot fungi suggests that with these fungi lignin degradation proceeds by way of extracellular mixed-function oxygenases and dioxygenases, which catalyse demethylations, hydroxylations and ring-fission reactions within a largely intact polymer, concomitant with some release of low molecular weight lignin fragments. There are also apparent relationships between lignin, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism for some organisms, but the relationships may vary from one organism to another. Although research is now mostly at a basic level, industrial applications may result from lignin degradation research. Considerable potential exists for the development of bioconversions which might produce low molecular weight chemicals from waste lignins, and thereby reduce our dependence on petroleum as a source of these chemicals. Alternatively, such bioconversions might produce chemically altered forms of polymeric lignin that may be valuable industrially. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

IZU-154 showed the most significant polyethylene degradation among the three lignin-degrading fungi under nitrogen- or carbon-limited culture conditions. Furthermore, for T. versicolor and P. chrysosporium, the addition of Mn(II) into nitrogen- or carbon-limited culture medium enhanced polyethylene degradation. These results suggest that polyethylene degradation is related to ligninolytic activity of lignin-degrading fungi. Treatment of polyethylene mem- brane with partially purified manganese peroxidase (MnP) caused significant degradation in the presence of Tween 80, Mn(II), and Mn(III) chelator. This result demonstrates that MnP is the key enzyme in polyethylene degradation by lignin-degrading fungi.},

Ten-day-heat-treated (70$\,^{\circ}$C) starch-polyethylene degradable plastic films were incubated with shaking with active or inactive enzyme for 3 weeks (37C). Active enzyme illustrated changes in the films' Fourier transform infrared spectra, mechanical properties, and polyethylene molecular weight distributions. There is a growing interest in the development of degrad-able plastics to enhance biodegradability of plastic products in landfills and composts. One type of these novel materials consists of starch-polyethylene-prooxidant degradable plas-tics, which are used in the composting of lawn, garden, and shrub litter. Recently, Lee et al.

In this paper, we describe the presence of an extracellular enzyme(s) produced by these bacteria that is capable of attacking and modifying the polyethylene portion of 10-day-heat-treated degradable plas-tics.

With the excessive use of plastics and increasing pressure being placed on capacities available for plastic waste disposal, the need for biodegradable plastics and biodegradation of plastic wastes has assumed increasing importance in the last few years. Awareness of the waste problem and its impact on the environment has awakened new interest in the area of degradable polymers. The interest in environmental issues is growing and there are increasing demands to develop material which do not burden the environment significantly. Biodegradation is necessary for water-soluble or water-immiscible polymers because they eventually enter streams which can neither be recycled nor incinerated. It is important to consider the microbial degradation of natural and synthetic polymers in order to understand what is necessary for biodegradation and the mechanisms involved. This requires understanding of the interactions between materials and microorganisms and the biochemical changes involved. Widespread studies on the biodegradation of plastics have been carried out in order to overcome the environmental problems associated with synthetic plastic waste. This paper reviews the current research on the biodegradation of biodegradable and also the conventional synthetic plastics and also use of various techniques for the analysis of degradation in vitro. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The development of aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters has combined excellent mechanical properties with biodegradability and an ideal replacement for the conventional nondegradable thermoplastics. The microorganisms degrading these polyesters are widely distributed in various environments. Although various aliphatic, aromatic, and aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester-degrading microorganisms and their enzymes have been studied and characterized, there are still many groups of microorganisms and enzymes with varying properties awaiting various applications. In this review, we have reported some new microorganisms and their enzymes which could degrade various aliphatic, aromatic, as well as aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters like poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene succinate)-co-(butylene adipate) (PBSA), poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and poly(3-hydoxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalterate) (PHB/PHBV), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), poly(butylene succinate-co-terephthalate) (PBST), and poly(butylene succinate/terephthalate/isophthalate)-co-(lactate) (PBSTIL). The mechanism of degradation of aliphatic as well as aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters has also been discussed. The degradation ability of microorganisms against various polyesters might be useful for the treatment and recycling of biodegradable wastes or bioremediation of the polyester-contaminated environments.},

Yet in the research reported here, we showed that Arabic speakers tend to conceptualize the future as behind and the past as ahead of them, despite using spoken metaphors that suggest the opposite. We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

	Abstract = {Bacteria are widespread in nature as they can adapt to any extreme environmental conditions and perform various physiological activities. Marine environments are one of the most adverse environments owing to their varying nature of temperature, pH, salinity, sea surface temperature, currents, precipitation regimes and wind patterns. Due to the constant variation of environmental conditions, the microorganisms present in that environment are more suitably adapted to the adverse conditions, hence, possessing complex characteristic features of adaptation. Therefore, the bacteria isolated from the marine environments are supposed to be better utilized in bioremediation of heavy metals, hydrocarbon and many other recalcitrant compounds and xenobiotics through biofilm formation and production of extracellular polymeric substances. Many marine bacteria have been reported to have bioremediation potential. The advantage of using marine bacteria for bioremediation in situ is the direct use of organisms in any adverse conditions without any genetic manipulation. This review emphasizes the utilization of marine bacteria in the field of bioremediation and understanding the mechanism behind acquiring the characteristic feature of adaptive responses.},

	Abstract = {Industrialization and urbanization have led to massive accumulation of plastic garbage all over India. The persistence of plastic in soil and aquatic environ-ment has become ecological threat to the metropolitan city such as Bangalore, India. Present study investigates an ecofriendly, efficient and cost-effective approach for plastic waste management by the screening of novel microbial consortia which are capable of degrading plastic polymers. Plastic-contaminated soil and water samples were collected from six hot spots of urban and rural areas of Bangalore. The plastic-degrading bacteria were enriched, and degradation ability was determined by zone of clearance method. The percentage of poly-mer degradation was initially monitored by weight loss method, and the main isolates were characterized by standard microbiology protocols. These isolates were used to form microbial consortia, and the degradation efficiency of the consortia was compared with individ-ual isolate and known strains obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) and Gene Bank, India. One of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation was identified, and the biodegra-dation mechanism was hypothesized by bioinformatics studies. From this study, it is evident that the bacteria utilized the plastic polymer as a sole source of carbon and showed 20--50 {\%} weight reduction over a period of 120 days. The two main bacteria responsible for the degradation were microbiologically characterized to be Pseudomonas spp. These bacteria could grow optimally at 37 $\,^{\circ}$C in pH 9.0 and showed 35--40 {\%} of plastic weight reduction over 120 days. These isolates were showed better degradation ability than known strains from MTCC. The current study further revealed that the microbial consortia formulated by combining Psuedomonas spp. showed 40 {\%} plastic weight reduc-tion over a period of 90 days. Further, extracellular lipase, one of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation, was identified. The computational docking studies suggested that polyethylene glycol and polysty-rene present in the plastics might have good interaction towards the microbial lipase with stable binding and interacting forces which probably could be one of the reasons for the degradative mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {A polyurethane (PU) degrading bacterial strain MZA-75 was isolated from soil through enrichment technique. The bacterium was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the phylogenetic analysis indicated the strain MZA-75 belonged to genus Bacillus having maximum similarity with Bacillus subtilis strain JBE0016. The degradation of PU films by strain MZA-75 in mineral salt medium (MSM) was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). SEM revealed the appearance of widespread cracks on the surface. FTIR spectrum showed decrease in ester functional group. Increase in polydispersity index was observed in GPC, which indicates chain scission as a result of microbial treatment. CO2 evolution and cell growth increased when PU was used as carbon source in MSM in Sturm test. Increase in both cell associated and extracellular esterases was observed in the presence of PU indicated by p-Nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis assay. Analysis of cell free supernatant by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that 1,4-butanediol and adipic acid monomers were produced. Bacillus subtilis strain MZA-75 can degrade the soft segment of polyester polyurethane, unfortunately no information about the fate of hard segment could be obtained. Growth of strain MZA-75 in the presence of these metabolites indicated mineralization of ester hydrolysis products into CO2 and H2O.},

A large number of marine species is known to be harmed and/or killed by plastic debris, which could jeopardize their survival, especially since many are already endangered by other forms of anthropogenic activities. Marine animals are mostly affected through entanglement in and ingestion of plastic litter. Other less known threats include the use of plastic debris by "invader" species and the absorption of polychlorinated biphenyls from ingested plastics. Less conspicuous forms, such as plastic pellets and "scrubbers" are also hazardous. To address the problem of plastic debris in the oceans is a difficult task, and a variety of approaches are urgently required. Some of the ways to mitigate the problem are discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract: Biodegradation of polythene bags and plastic cups was analyzed after 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of incu-bation in the mangrove soil. The biodegradation of polythene bags was significantly higher (up to 4.21{\%} in 9 months) than that of plastic cups (up to 0.25{\%} in 9 months). Microbial counts in the degrading materials were recorded up to 79.67 x 10'' per gram for total heterotrophic bacteria, and up to 55.33 x 10{\^{}} per gram for fungi. The microbial species found associated with the degrading materials were identified as five Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria, and eight fungal species of Aspergillus. The species that were predominant were Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus (Gram +ve), Moraxella, and Pseudomonas (Gram -ve) and two species of fungi (Aspergillus glaucus and A. niger). Efficacy of the microbial species in degradation of plastics and polythene was analyzed in shaker cultures. Among the bacteria, Pseudomonas species degraded 20.54{\%} of polythene and 8.16{\%} of plastics in one-month period. Among the fungal species, Aspergillus glaucus degraded 28.80{\%} of polythene and 7.26{\%} of plastics in one-month period. This work reveals that the mangrove soil is a good source of microbes capable of degrading polythene and plastics.},

Results obtained revealed that Pseudomonas fluorescens was the most active of the tested microorganisms degrading approximately 18{\%} and 16{\%} of polythene at 9 and 12months period respectively and 3.8{\%} of plastics in twelve month period under field condition. Also, 8.06 and 5.63{\%} of polythene and plastics were respectively degraded in a month under laboratory condition. The biodegradation of the polythene material was relatively faster and earlier than that of the plastics with the polythene degrading for up to 12.94, 16 and 15{\%} at 9 months of analysis while only 2, 3.8 and 4.8{\%} of the plastic materials were degraded at 12month Kfor each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Aspergillus niger respectively.
