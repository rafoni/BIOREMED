	Abstract = {A review. Plastics are present in a lot of aspects of everyday life. They are very versatile and resistant to microbial attack. Polyurethanes are used in several industries and are divided in polyester and polyether polyurethanes and there are different types among them. Despite their microbial resistance, they are susceptible to the attack of fungi and bacteria but the mechanism to elucidate its biodegrdn. are unknown. There are reports from bacteria and fungi that are capable of degrading polyurethane but the studies about the enzymes that attack the plastic are focused on bacterial enzymes only. The enzymes reported are of type esterase and protease mainly since these enzymes are very unspecific and can recognize some regions in the polyurethane mol. and hydrolyze it. Fungal enzymes were studied prior the 1990s decade but recently, some authors report the use of filamentous fungi to degrade polyurethane and also report some characteristics of the enzymes involved in it. This review approaches polyurethane biodegrdn. by focusing on the enzymes reported to date. [on SciFinder(R)]},

	Abstract = {Lack of degradability and the closing of landfill sites as well as growing water and land pollution problems have led to concern about plastics. Increasingly, raw materials such as crude oil are in short supply for the synthesis of plastics, and the recycling of waste plastics is becoming more important. As the importance of recycling increases, so do studies on elucidation of the biodegradability of polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are an important and versatile class of man-made polymers used in a wide variety of products in the medical, automotive and industrial fields. Polyurethane is a general term used for a class of polymers derived from the condensation of polyisocyanates and polyalcohols. Despite its xenobiotic origins, polyurethane has been found to be susceptible to biodegradation by naturally occurring microorganisms. Microbial degradation of polyurethanes is dependent on the many properties of the polymer such as molecular orientation, crystallinity, cross-linking and chemical groups present in the molecular chains which determine the accessibility to degrading-enzymc systems. Esterase activity (both membrane-bound and extracellular) has been noted in microbes which allow them to utilize polyurethane. Microbial degradation of polyester polyurethane is hypothosizcd to be mainly due to the hydrolysis of ester bonds by these esterase enzymes. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Information technologies have evolved to an enabling science for natural resource management and conservation, environmental engineering, scientific simulation and integrated assessment studies. Computing plays a significant role in every day practices of environmental engineers, natural scientists, economists, and social scientists. The complexity of natural phenomena require interdisciplinary approaches, where computing science offers the infrastructure for environmental data collection and management, scientific simulations, decision support, documentation and reporting. Ecology, environmental engineering and natural resource management comprise an excellent real-world testbed for IT system demonstration, while bring up new challenges for computer science. Complexity, uncertainty and scaling issues of natural systems set up a demanding application domain for sensor networks and earth observation systems; modelling, simulation and scientific workflows; data management and reporting; decision support and intelligent systems; distributed computing environments; geographical information systems; heterogeneous systems integration; software engineering; accounting systems; and control systems.This books offers a collection of papers presented at the 4th International Symposium on Environmental Engineering, held in May 2009, in Thessaloniki, Greece. Recent success stories in ecoinformatics, promising ideas and new challenges are discussed among computer scientists, environmental engineers, economists and social scientists, demonstrating new paradigms for problem solving and decision making.},

	Abstract = {Accumulation of electronic waste has increased catastrophically and out of that various plastic resins constitute one of the leading thrown out materials in the electronic machinery. Enrichment medium, containing high impact polystyrene (HIPS) with decabromodiphenyl oxide and antimony trioxide as sole carbon source, was used to isolate microbial cultures. The viability of these cultures in the e-plastic containing mineral medium was further confirmed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction test. Four cultures were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sedlakii, Alcaligenes sp. and Brevundimonas diminuta. Biodegradation experiments were carried out in flask level and gelatin supplementation (0.1{\%} w/v) along with HIPS had increased the degradation rate to a maximum of 12.4{\%} (w/w) within 30??days. This is the first report for this kind of material. The comparison of FTIR, NMR, and TGA analysis of original and degraded e-plastic films revealed structural changes under microbial treatment. Polystyrene degradation intermediates in the culture supernatant were also detected using HPLC analysis. The gravity of biodegradation was validated by morphological changes under scanning electron microscope. All isolates displayed depolymerase activity to substantiate enzymatic degradation of e-plastic.},

	Abstract = {Polystyrene (PS) is generally considered to be durable and resistant to biodegradation. Mealworms (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) from different sources chew and eat Styrofoam, a common PS product. The Styrofoam was efficiently degraded in the larval gut within a retention time of less than 24 h. Fed with Styrofoam as the sole diet, the larvae lived as well as those fed with a normal diet (bran) over a period of 1 month. The analysis of fecula egested from Styrofoam-feeding larvae, using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), solid-state 13C cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared (TG?FTIR) spectroscopy, substantiated that cleavage/depolymerization of long-chain PS molecules and the formation of depolymerized metabolites occurred in the larval gut. Within a 16 day test period, 47.7{\%} of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2 and the residue (ca. 49.2{\%}) was egested as fecula with a limited fraction incorporated into biomass (ca. 0.5{\%}). Tests with $\alpha$ 13C- or ? 13C-labeled PS confirmed that the 13C-labeled PS was mineralized to 13CO2 and incorporated into lipids.

	Abstract = {The role of gut bacteria of mealworms (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) in polystyrene (PS) degradation was investigated. Gentamicin was the most effective inhibitor of gut bacteria among six antibiotics tested. Gut bacterial activities were essentially suppressed by feeding gentamicin food (30 mg/g) for 10 days. Gentamicin-feeding mealworms lost the ability to depolymerize PS and mineralize PS into CO2, as determined by characterizing worm fecula and feeding with 13C-labeled PS. A PS-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from the guts of the mealworms, Exiguobacterium sp. strain YT2, which could form biofilm on PS film over a 28 day incubation period and made obvious pits and cavities (0.2?0.3 mm in width) on PS film surfaces associated with decreases in hydrophobicity and the formation of C?O polar groups. A suspension culture of strain YT2 (108 cells/mL) was able to degrade 7.4 $\pm$ 0.4{\%} of the PS pieces (2500 mg/L) over a 60 day incubation period. The molecular weight of the residual PS pieces was lower, and the release of water-soluble daughter products was detected.

	Abstract = {Polystyrene, which is one of the most utilized thermoplastics, is highly durable and is considered to be non-biodegradable. Hence, polystyrene waste accumulates in the environment posing an increasing ecological threat. In a previous study we have isolated a biofilm-producing strain (C208) of the actinomycete Rhodococcus ruber that degraded polyethylene films. Formation of biofilm, by C208, improved the biodegradation of polyethylene. Consequently, the present study aimed at monitoring the kinetics of biofilm formation by C208 on polystyrene, determining the physiological activity of the biofilm and analyzing its capacity to degrade polystyrene. Quantification of the biofilm biomass was performed using a modified crystal violet (CV) staining or by monitoring the protein content in the biofilm. When cultured on polystyrene flakes, most of the bacterial cells adhered to the polystyrene surface within few hours, forming a biofilm. The growth of the on polystyrene showed a pattern similar to that of a planktonic culture. Furthermore, the respiration rate, of the biofilm, exhibited a pattern similar to that of the biofilm growth. In contrast, the respiration activity of the planktonic population showed a constant decline with time. Addition of mineral oil (0.005{\%} w/v), but not non-ionic surfactants, increased the biofilm biomass. Extended incubation of the biofilm for up to 8 weeks resulted in a small reduction in the polystyrene weight (0.8{\%} of gravimetric weight loss). This study demonstrates the high affinity of C208 to polystyrene which lead to biofilm formation and, presumably, induced partial biodegradation.},

	Abstract = {The alteration and weathering of stone is basically determined by natural and anthropogenic impacts influencing various physical, chemical and biological damage factors at the object site. Whether as direct or catalytically enhancing factor, the biodeterioration of stone is coupled with nearly all environmentally induced degradation processes: the presence of the one makes deterioration by the other all the more effective. The bioreceptivity of stone is described by its structure and chemical composition, while the intensity of the microbial contamination is determined by the referring climatic conditions and the anthropogenic euthrophication of the atmosphere. The microflora improves the nutrient and moisture-restricted growth conditions on building stones by the formation of surface-covering biofilms. Besides the aesthetical impairment caused by the coloured biopatina, the biofouling effect promotes even "abiotic" deterioration processes due to the alteration of the material structure as well as their thermo-hygric properties; in addition, mechanical pressure due to the shrinking and swelling of the colloidal biofilms might cause a further weakening of the mineral lattice. Acidolytic and oxido-reductive biocorrosion processes complete the biodeteriorating attack of stone acting as a preliminary precursor for the latter formation of detrimental crusts. Suitable and reliable methods for the detection of biodeterioration processes are available, but only the interdisciplinary diagnosis and evaluation of the entire decay process of stone allows the formulation of adaequate countermeasure strategies. In case the significance of biodeterioration impacts is proven, the possible effects of the microbial contamination on cleaning procedures, protective treatments as well as biocidal applications has to be considered. This paper will give a comprehensive overview to the biodeterioration of stone and stresses the practical relevance for the conservation. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The degradation of a commercial environmentally degradable polyethylene was investigated in two stages. Firstly by abiotic oxidation in an air oven to simulate the effect of the compost environment and secondly in the presence of selected microorganisms. Initial biofilm formation was followed by fluorescence microscopy and the subsequent growth of bacteria on the surface of the plastic was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that microbial growth occurred on the presence of PE samples that had been compression moulded to thick sections but had not been deliberately pre-oxidised. Molecular enlargement and broadening of molecular weight distribution occurred after preheating in air at 60 ??C but not at ambient temperatures but colonisation of microorganisms occurred on all samples. Erosion of the film surface was observed in the vicinity of the microorganisms and the decay of oxidation products in the surface of the polymer film was measured by FTIR measurements and was found to be associated with the formation of protein and polysaccharides, attributable to the growth of the microorganisms. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Biodeterioration of polymeric materials affect a wide range of industries. Degradability of polymeric materials is a function of the structures of polymeric materials, the presence of degradative microbial population and the environmental conditions that encourage microbial growth. Our understanding of polymer degradation has been advanced in recent years, but the subject is still inadequately addressed. This is clearly indicated by the lack of information available on biodeterioration of polymeric materials, particularly the mechanisms involved and the microorganisms participated. In this review, polymers are treated according to their origin and biodegradability, and grouped as biopolymer, chemically modified natural polymers and recalcitrant polymers. Selective examples are used to illustrate the mechanisms and microorganisms involved in degradation of specific polymeric materials, and detection methods used for degradation and deterioration tests are discussed. In addition, new detection techniques and preventive measures are also presented. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The individual thermophilic strain Thermomonospora fusca, isolated from compost material, was used for the degradation experiments in a defined synthetic medium at 55$\,^{\circ}$C. After 22 days of degradation more than 99.9{\%} of the polymer had depolymerized and with regard to the degradation of the diacid and diol components of Ecoflex{\textregistered} only the monomers of the copolyesters (1,4-butanediol, terephthalate and adipate) could be detected by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) measurements in the medium. In interrupted degradation experiments predominantly the monoesters of adipic acid and terephthalic acid with 1,4-butanediol were observed in addition to the monomers. In toxicological tests with Daphnia magna and Photobacterium phosphoreum no significant toxicological effect was observed, neither for the monomeric intermediates nor for the oligomeric intermediates. From a risk assessment it can be concluded that there is no indication for an environmental risk when aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters of the Ecoflex-type are introduced into composting processes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

In the subtilisin and trypsin families, the composition and arrangement of the catalytic triad do not vary significantly. However, the mechanisms of action of many other hydrolytic enzymes, which target a wide range of substrates, involve nucleophilic attack by a serine (or threonine) residue. Review of these enzymes shows that the acid-base-ser/thr pattern of catalytic residues is generally conserved, although the individual acids and bases can vary. The variations in sequence and organization illustrate the adaptability shown by proteins in generating catalytic stereochemistry on different main-chain frameworks.

	Abstract = {Feruloyl esterase (FAE) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the ferulic and diferulic acids present in plant cell wall polysaccharides, and tannase catalyzes the hydrolysis of tannins to release gallic acid. The fungal tannase family in the ESTHER database contains various enzymes, including FAEs and tannases. Despite the importance of FAEs and tannases in bioindustrial applications, three-dimensional structures of the fungal tannase family members have been unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of FAE B from Aspergillus oryzae (AoFaeB), which belongs to the fungal tannase family, at 1.5 {\AA} resolution. AoFaeB consists of a catalytic $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold domain and a large lid domain, and the latter has a novel fold. To estimate probable binding models of substrates in AoFaeB, an automated docking analysis was performed. In the active site pocket of AoFaeB, residues responsible for the substrate specificity of the FAE activity were identified. The catalytic triad of AoFaeB comprises Ser203, Asp417, and His457, and the serine and histidine residues are directly connected by a disulfide bond of the neighboring cysteine residues, Cys202 and Cys458. This structural feature, the "CS-D-HC motif," is unprecedented in serine hydrolases. A mutational analysis indicated that the novel structural motif plays essential roles in the function of the active site.},

Because the ability to enzymatically degrade PET has been thought to be limited to a few fungal species, biodegradation is not yet a viable remediation or recycling strategy. By screening natural microbial communities exposed to PET in the environment, we isolated a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that is able to use PET as its major energy and carbon source. When grown on PET, this strain produces two enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET and the reaction intermediate, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. Both enzymes are required to enzymatically convert PET efficiently into its two environmentally benign monomers, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.},

	Abstract = {The gene encoding a cutinase homolog, LC-cutinase, was cloned from a fosmid library of a leaf-branch compost metagenome by functional screening using tributyrin agar plates. LC-cutinase shows the highest amino acid sequence identity of 59.7{\%} to Thermomonospora curvata lipase. It also shows the 57.4{\%} identity to Thermobifida fusca cutinase. When LC-cutinase without a putative signal peptide was secreted to the periplasm of Escherichia coli cells with the assistance of the pelB leader sequence, more than 50{\%} of the recombinant protein, termed LC-cutinase*, was excreted into the extracellular medium. It was purified and characterized. LC-cutinase* hydrolyzed various fatty acid monoesters with acyl chain lengths of 2 to 18, with a preference for short-chain substrates (C(4) substrate at most) most optimally at pH 8.5 and 50$\,^{\circ}$C, but could not hydrolyze olive oil. It lost activity with half-lives of 40 min at 70$\,^{\circ}$C and 7 min at 80$\,^{\circ}$C. LC-cutinase* had an ability to degrade poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The specific PET-degrading activity of LC-cutinase* was determined to be 12 mg/h/mg of enzyme (2.7 mg/h/$\mu$kat of pNP-butyrate-degrading activity) at pH 8.0 and 50$\,^{\circ}$C. This activity is higher than those of the bacterial and fungal cutinases reported thus far, suggesting that LC-cutinase* not only serves as a good model for understanding the molecular mechanism of PET-degrading enzyme but also is potentially applicable for surface modification and degradation of PET.},

We have crystallized and structurally characterized a cutinase from Thermobifida fusca KW3 (TfCut2) in free as well as in inhibitor-bound form. Together with our analysis of the thermal stability and modelling studies, we suggest possible reasons for the outstanding thermostability in comparison to the less thermostable homolog from Thermobifida alba AHK119 and propose a model for the binding of the enzyme towards its polymeric substrate.

Important chemical changes of polymeric chains were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. After the microscopic and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies, specific microbial media was used to isolate and identify the bacteria from the degrading polyethylene terephthalate. Degradation impact by microbes on the crystalline structure and presence of microbes inside the polyethylene terephthalate were seen in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs. A record of loss in weight and tensile strength were also made. Esterase was found to be involved in the biodegradation. Although the biodegradation was slow and weak, we demonstrated with chemical and x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) as well as with SEM micrographs that microbes and esterase could act on the polyethylene terephthalate. The microbe involved was confirmed to be a Nocardia species.},

	Abstract = {Microfungi were selectively isolated for production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber-degrading enzymes potentially to be used to modify the surface of polyester fabric. A range of fungi were isolated from plant surfaces and soil samples using a polycaprolactone (PCL) plate-clearing assay technique, and screened for cutinolytic esterase (cutinase) activity. Twenty-two of 115 isolates showed clearing indicating the production of cutinase. The ability of the fungi to produce cutinase in mineral medium (MM) using either potato suberin or PET (1 cm of untreated pre-washed PET fiber) fiber as substrates was assessed based on the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB). All isolates exhibited activity towards p-NPB, isolate PBURU-B5 giving the highest activity with PET fiber as an inducer. PBURU-B5 was identified as Fusarium solani based on its conidial morphology and also nucleotide sequencing from internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA-ITS). Enzymatic modification of PET cloth material properties using crude enzyme from strain PBURU-B5 showed hydrolysis of ester bonds of the PET fiber. The modification of the PET fabric resulted in increase of water and moisture absorption, and general enhancement of hydrophilicity of the fabric, properties that could facilitate processing of fabric ranging from easier dyeing while also yielding a softer feeling fabric for the user.},

Although some authors claim to enhance the biodegradation properties of this aromatic polyester by copolymerization with readily hydrolysable aliphatic polyesters, no clear and satisfying conclusions can yet be formulated. Poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-lactic acid), poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-ethylene glycol), and poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-epsilon-caprolactone) block and random copolymers are the modifications mainly investigated for biodegradable applications.

Composting for instance could so be established as an alternative waste management system for parts of the plastic waste. Within this group of innovative polymer, polyesters play a predominant role, due to their potentially hydrolyzable ester bonds. While aromatic polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) exhibit excellent material properties but proved to be almost resistant to microbial attack, many aliphatic polyesters turned out to be biodegradable but lack in properties, which are important for application. To combine good material properties with biodegradability, aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters have been developed as biodegradable polymers for many years. This article reviews the attempts to combine aromatic and aliphatic structures in biodegradable plastics and work, which has been done to evaluate the degradation behaviour and environmental safety of biodegradable polyesters, containing aromatic constituents. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	Abstract = {Recently, research on polymer has drawn much attention mainly due to the ever increasing application of these polymeric materials in several areas such as food packaging industry, agricultural industry and biomedical research. However, increasing industrial use of polymers has led to the environmentally critical issue of waste disposal. Further, the successful implication of polymeric materials in biomedical applications depends on the biodegradability of the concerned polymer. Various enzymes play an important role in the biodegradation of polymers. The present review describes the enzyme mediated biodegradation of various polymers including synthetic, natural and blends of these materials. Detailed examples of enzymatic degradation of polymers are illustrated from current scientific literature with the discussion on various factors that can influence the degradation. In addition, different techniques that are generally applied to assess the degradation process as well as degradation products have been described. Finally, a special emphasis is given to the investigation of the kinetics of polymer degradation by enzymes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

	Abstract = {Biofilms are surface-attached agglomerations of microorganisms embedded in an extracellular matrix. Biofilm-associated infections are difficult to eradicate and represent a significant reservoir for disseminating and recurring serious infections. Infections involving biofilms frequently develop on indwelling medical devices in hospitalized patients, and Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading cause of infection in this setting. However, the molecular determinants of biofilm dissemination are unknown. Here we have demonstrated that specific secreted, surfactant-like S. epidermidis peptides--the $\beta$ subclass of phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs)--promote S. epidermidis biofilm structuring and detachment in vitro and dissemination from colonized catheters in a mouse model of device-related infection. Our study establishes in vivo significance of biofilm detachment mechanisms for the systemic spread of biofilm-associated infection and identifies the effectors of biofilm maturation and detachment in a premier biofilm-forming pathogen. Furthermore, by demonstrating that antibodies against PSM$\beta$ peptides inhibited bacterial spread from indwelling medical devices, we have provided proof of principle that interfering with biofilm detachment mechanisms may prevent dissemination of biofilm-associated infection.},

In this context, an attempt was made to study the biodegradation of polyethylene films in the natural environment. The method suggested by ASTM standards, i.e. composting of polythene films with municipal solid waste, was adopted to examine the biodegradation of plastics in the natural environment. The samples were collected and tested for weight loss and reduction in tensile strength at 2 months interval for 12 months of composting. Loss of weight and reduction in tensile strength of polythene films were taken as the criteria indicating biodegradation of these materials. Composting of polythene films for 4 months did not show any degradation. After 4 months of composting, the loss in weight was 2.9-4.5{\%} for HDPE films and 10.5-11.6{\%} for LDPE films. Similarly, the reduction in tensile strength ranges from 16-20{\%} for HDPE and 12-13{\%} for LDPE films. The study indicates that the biodegradation of polythene films occur in natural environment at a very slower rate.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: Assessment of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-degrading bacteria isolated from plastic waste dumpsites of Gulf of Mannar. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rationally, 15 bacteria (GMB1-GMB15) were isolated by enrichment technique. GMB5 and GMB7 were selected for further studies based on their efficiency to degrade the HDPE and identified as Arthrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Assessed weight loss of HDPE after 30 days of incubation was nearly 12{\%} for Arthrobacter sp. and 15{\%} for Pseudomonas sp. The bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay showed that the cell surface hydrophobicity of Pseudomonas sp. was higher than Arthrobacter sp. Both fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and protein content of the biofilm were used to test the viability and protein density of the biomass. Acute peak elevation was observed between 2 and 5 days of inoculation for both bacteria. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum showed that keto carbonyl bond index (KCBI), Ester carbonyl bond index (ECBI) and Vinyl bond index (VBI) were increased indicating changes in functional group(s) and/or side chain modification confirming the biodegradation. CONCLUSION: The results pose us to suggest that both Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter sp. were proven efficient to degrade HDPE, albeit the former was more efficacious, yet the ability of latter cannot be neglected. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Recent alarm on ecological threats to marine system is dumping plastic waste in the marine ecosystem and coastal arena by anthropogenic activity. In maintenance phase of the plastic-derived polyethylene waste, the microbial degradation plays a major role; the information accomplished in this work will be the initiating point for the degradation of polyethylene by indigenous bacterial population in the marine ecosystem and provides a novel eco-friendly solution in eco-management.},

The ability of the bacterial isolates to produce various hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase, gelatinase and lipase were determined using the plate assay. The heterotrophic bacterial load was considerably higher than the fungal load. There was a predominance of the gram positive genus, Bacillus. Other genera encountered included Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Listeria and Vibrio. Their effectiveness on the degradation of commercial polythene carry bags made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied over a period of eight weeks in the laboratory. Biodegradation was measured in terms of mean weight loss, which was nearly 5 {\%} after a period of eight weeks. There was a significant increase in the bacterial load of the soil attached to class 2 (HDPE) polythene. After eight weeks of submergence in mangrove soil, soil attached to class 1 and class 3 polythene mostly had Bacillus (Staphylococcus predominated in class 2 polythene). While most of the isolates were capable of producing hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase and gelatinase, lipolytic activity was low. Class 2 HDPE suffered the greatest biodegradation.},

	Abstract = {Environmental threats restrict the use of nondegradable polymers and encourage the development and use of degradable plastics. In order to obtain a cost-effective biodegradable plastic, starch-filled polyethylene (PE) is still the best alternative. Starch and PE blend is incompatible at the molecular level and often leads to poor performance. In order to overcome this drawback, either PE or starch should be modified. The aim of this study was to modified linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and blend it with starch. Maleic anhydride (MA) was grafted onto LLDPE in xylene using dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as an initiator. Corn starch in varying concentrations (between 10 and 60{\%}) was blended with MA-g-LLDPE in a torque rheometer. The same blend compositions of nonfunctional LLDPE with the starch were prepared for comparative studies. The torque and totalized torque generated during blending are reported as a function of starch content. Torque decreased with increasing starch content for the compositions from 10 to 50{\%} and increased for 60{\%} starch content. Work energy decreased for all the compositions of blends except for 60{\%} starch content. Tensile strength and modulus increased and percentage elongation decreased as the starch content increased in the blends. Water absorption of the blends increased with an increase in starch content. The biodegradability of MA-g-LLDPE/starch blends have been studied in two biotic environments: (1) soil environment over a period of 6 months; (2) mixed fungi inoculum (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium funiculosum, Chaetomium globosum, Gliocladium virens and Pullularia pullulans) for 28 days. The samples containing more than 30{\%} starch content supported heavy fungus growth. Blends exposed to a soil environment degraded more than in fungi alone. Any changes in the various properties of the MA-g-LLDPE/starch before and after degradation were monitored using FTIR spectroscopy, weight loss, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for surface morphology, a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) for crystallinity and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) for rapid determination of starch content. Percentage crystallinity decreased as the starch content increased and biodegradation resulted in an increase of crystallinity in MA-g-LLDPE/starch blends.},

Ironically, the most preferred property of plastics - durability - exerts also the major environmental threat. Recycling has practically failed to provide a safe solution for disposal of plastic waste (only 5{\%} out of 1 trillion plastic bags, annually produced in the US alone, are being recycled). Since the most utilized plastic is polyethylene (PE; ca. 140 million tons/year), any reduction in the accumulation of PE waste alone would have a major impact on the overall reduction of the plastic waste in the environment. Since PE is considered to be practically inert, efforts were made to isolate unique microorganisms capable of utilizing synthetic polymers.

	Abstract = {The biodegradation of several polymers that had been buried under soil for over 32 years was examined. No evidence of biodegradation was found for polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and urea formaldehyde resin. A remarkable degradation was indicated for low density polyethylene thin films which were directly in contact with soil. Severely degraded parts of the film is characterized by whitening. Many small holes were recognized on the surface of the whitened part. The whitened part is specific for the growth of hyphae. FT-IR spectra of the whitened part showed a characteristic band in the vicinity of 1640 cm1 which was assigned to the stretching vibration of CC bond. Although the part which was not in contact with soil was clear, it also showed evidence of degradation from the presence of carbonyl band in FT-IR. It was suggested that the degradation of the clear part is due to the usual thermo-oxidative process, while the degradation of the whitened part is due to the biotic process. 1995 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Proxidant additives represent a promising solution to the problem of the environment contamination with polyethylene film litter. Pro-oxidants accelerate photo- and thermo-oxidation and consequent polymer chain cleavage rendering the product apparently more susceptible to biodegradation. In the present study, fungal strain, Aspergillus oryzae isolated from HDPE film (buried in soil for 3 months) utilized abiotically treated polyethylene (LDPE) as a sole carbon source and degraded it. Treatment with pro-oxidant, manganese stearate followed by UV irradiation and incubation with A. oryzae resulted in maximum decrease in percentage of elongation and tensile strength by 62 and 51{\%}, respectively, compared with other pro-oxidant treated LDPE films which showed 45{\%} (titanium stearate), 40{\%} (iron stearate), and 39{\%} (cobalt stearate) decrease in tensile strength. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of proxidant treated LDPE films revealed generation of more number of carbonyl and carboxylic groups (1630-1840 cm(-1) and 1220-1340 cm(-1)) compared with UV treated film. When these films were incubated with A. oryzae for 3 months complete degradation of carbonyl and carboxylic groups was achieved. Scanning electron microscopy of untreated and treated LDPE films also revealed that polymer has undergone degradation after abiotic and biotic treatments. This concludes proxidant treatment before UV irradiation accelerated photo-oxidation of LDPE, caused functional groups to be generated in the polyethylene film and this resulted in biodegradation due to the consumption of carbonyl and carboxylic groups by A. oryzae which was evident by reduction in carbonyl peaks. Among the pro-oxidants, manganese stearate treatment caused maximum degradation of polyethylene. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 120: 3536-3545, 2011},

	Abstract = {Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is one of the most widely applied techniques for the investigation of cultural heritage materials. FTIR microscopy is well established as an essential tool in the microdestructive analysis of small samples, and the recent introduction of mapping and imaging equipment allows the collection of a large number of FTIR spectra on a surface, providing a distribution map of identified compounds. In this Account, we report recent advances in FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy in our research group. Our laboratory develops, tests, and refines new and less-studied IR spectroscopy and microscopy methods, with the goal of their adoption as routine analytical techniques in conservation laboratories. We discuss (i) the analysis of inorganic materials inactive in the mid-IR region by means of far-IR spectroscopy, (ii) the development of new methods for preparing cross sections, (iii) the characterization and spatial location of thin layers and small particles, and (iv) the evaluation of protective treatments. FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy have been mostly used in the mid-IR region of 4000-600 cm(-1). Some inorganic pigments, however, are inactive in this region, so other spectroscopic techniques have been applied, such as Raman spectroscopy. We suggest an alternative: harnessing the far-IR (600-50 cm(-1)). Our initial results show that far-IR spectroscopy is exceptionally useful with mural paintings or with corrosion products from which larger sample quantities can generally be collected. Moreover, the inorganic composition of a sample can be characterized by the presence of several compounds that are inactive in the mid-IR range (such as sulfides, oxides, and so forth). Stratigraphical analyses by FTIR microscopy can be hindered by the process of cross section preparation, which often involves an embedding organic polymer penetrating the sample's porous structure. Here, the polymer bands may completely cover the bands of organic compounds in the sample. However, a correct methodological approach can prevent such limitations. For example, it is always advisable to analyze the sample surface before preparing the cross section in order to characterize the preparation layers and the varnish layers, which are generally applied to the surface of a painting both to protect it and improve the color saturation. Furthermore, the innovative use of IR-transparent salts as embedding material for cross sections can prevent contamination of the embedding resin and improve detection of organic substances. Another key point in the use of FTIR microscopy in artwork analysis is spatial resolution. The high-energy output of a new integrated FTIR microscope enhances the ability to characterize and spatially locate small particles and thin layers. Moreover, the new configuration proves extremely useful in the evaluation of protective treatments, because larger areas may be analyzed in less time in comparison to traditional systems, allowing the collection of more statistical data.},

	Abstract = {Low density polythene (LDPE) is the most widely used packaging material primarily because of its excellent mechanical properties, barrier properties against water, light weight, low cost and high energy effectiveness. However, due to its ubiquitous nature, and resistance to biodegradability, the disposal strategies are crucial and need attention. Recently, microorganisms have become the focus of interest for environmental friendly disposal of plastic and polymer-based waste. This manuscript aims to investigate the extent of biodegradability of LDPE by four different strains of Pseudomonas bacteria-Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (ATCC 15729), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15692), Pseudomonas putida (KT2440 ATCC 47054) and Pseudomonas syringae (DC3000 ATCC 10862). Degradation of LDPE was determined by weight loss of the sample, morphological changes, mechanical and spectroscopic variations. The eluted compounds after degradation were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. Our results show that Pseudomonas spp. can degrade LDPE films.},

	Abstract = {Lignin is the most abundant renewable source of aromatic polymer in nature, and its decomposition is indispensable for carbon recycling. It is chemically recalcitrant to breakdown by most organisms because of the complex, heterogeneous structure. The white-rot fungi produce an array of extracellular oxidative enzymes that synergistically and efficiently degrade lignin. The major groups of ligninolytic enzymes include lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, versatile peroxidases, and laccases. The peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes with catalytic cycles that involve the activation by H2O2 and substrate reduction of compound I and compound II intermediates. Lignin peroxidases have the unique ability to catalyze oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds and ether (C-O-C) bonds in non-phenolic aromatic substrates of high redox potential. Manganese peroxidases oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III), which facilitates the degradation of phenolic compounds or, in turn, oxidizes a second mediator for the breakdown of non-phenolic compounds. Versatile peroxidases are hybrids of lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase with a bifunctional characteristic. Laccases are multi-copper-containing proteins that catalyze the oxidation of phenolic substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. This review covers the chemical nature of lignin substrates and focuses on the biochemical properties, molecular structures, reaction mechanisms, and related structures/functions of these enzymes.},

The other members of this group are the plant ascorbate oxidases and the mammalian plasma protein ceruloplasmin.

@article{Ferraroni2007,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laccases belong to multicopper oxidases, a widespread class of enzymes implicated in many oxidative functions in pathogenesis, immunogenesis and morphogenesis of organisms and in the metabolic turnover of complex organic substances. They catalyze the coupling between the four one-electron oxidations of a broad range of substrates with the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water. These catalytic processes are made possible by the contemporaneous presence of at least four copper ion sites, classified according to their spectroscopic properties: one type 1 (T1) site where the electrons from the reducing substrates are accepted, one type 2 (T2), and a coupled binuclear type 3 pair (T3) which are assembled in a T2/T3 trinuclear cluster where the electrons are transferred to perform the O2 reduction to H2O.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The structure of a laccase from the white-rot fungus Lentinus (Panus) tigrinus, a glycoenzyme involved in lignin biodegradation, was solved at 1.5 A. It reveals a asymmetric unit containing two laccase molecules (A and B). The progressive reduction of the copper ions centers obtained by the long-term exposure of the crystals to the high-intensity X-ray synchrotron beam radiation under aerobic conditions and high pH allowed us to detect two sequential intermediates in the molecular oxygen reduction pathway: the "peroxide" and the "native" intermediates, previously hypothesized through spectroscopic, kinetic and molecular mechanics studies. Specifically the electron-density maps revealed the presence of an end-on bridging, micro-eta 1:eta 1 peroxide ion between the two T3 coppers in molecule B, result of a two-electrons reduction, whereas in molecule A an oxo ion bridging the three coppers of the T2/T3 cluster (micro3-oxo bridge) together with an hydroxide ion externally bridging the two T3 copper ions, products of the four-electrons reduction of molecular oxygen, were best modelled.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This is the first structure of a multicopper oxidase which allowed the detection of two intermediates in the molecular oxygen reduction and splitting. The observed features allow to positively substantiate an accurate mechanism of dioxygen reduction catalyzed by multicopper oxidases providing general insights into the reductive cleavage of the O-O bonds, a leading problem in many areas of biology.},

	Abstract = {The transformations of lignin that occur during its biodegradation are complex and incompletely understood. Certain fungi of the white-rot group, and possibly other fungi and bacteria, completely decompose lignin to carbon dioxide and water. Other fungi and bacteria apparently degrade lignin incompletely. Differences in lignin-degrading abilities observed for different organisms may result from differences in the completeness of their ligninolytic enzyme systems. Not all lignin components may be attacked by a particular organism. Alternatively, different organisms may differ in their basic mechanisms of attack on lignin. The basic pathways of lignin degradation have been elucidated only for certain representatives of the white-and brown-rot fungi. Although it is known that each of the principal structural components of lignin is attacked by other fungi and bacteria, the biochemistry of that attack has not been elucidated. Work with low molecular weight lignin models has provided only limited information on possible pathways of lignin degradation by microorganisms. There is little evidence to suggest a correlation between abilities to degrade single-ring aromatic or lignin model compounds and the ability to degrade polymeric lignin. More evidence has come from analysis of spent culture media for lignin breakdown products and from comparative chemical analyses of sound lignins versus decayed lignin residues. Accumulated evidence with the most thoroughly studied white-rot fungi suggests that with these fungi lignin degradation proceeds by way of extracellular mixed-function oxygenases and dioxygenases, which catalyse demethylations, hydroxylations and ring-fission reactions within a largely intact polymer, concomitant with some release of low molecular weight lignin fragments. There are also apparent relationships between lignin, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism for some organisms, but the relationships may vary from one organism to another. Although research is now mostly at a basic level, industrial applications may result from lignin degradation research. Considerable potential exists for the development of bioconversions which might produce low molecular weight chemicals from waste lignins, and thereby reduce our dependence on petroleum as a source of these chemicals. Alternatively, such bioconversions might produce chemically altered forms of polymeric lignin that may be valuable industrially. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

	Abstract = {Degradation of high-molecular-weight polyethy- lene membrane by lignin-degrading fungi, IZU-154, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Trarnetes versicolor, was investigated under various nutritional conditions. IZU-154 showed the most significant polyethylene degradation among the three lignin-degrading fungi under nitrogen- or carbon-limited culture conditions. Furthermore, for T. versicolor and P. chrysosporium, the addition of Mn(II) into nitrogen- or carbon-limited culture medium enhanced polyethylene degradation. These results suggest that polyethylene degradation is related to ligninolytic activity of lignin-degrading fungi. Treatment of polyethylene mem- brane with partially purified manganese peroxidase (MnP) caused significant degradation in the presence of Tween 80, Mn(II), and Mn(III) chelator. This result demonstrates that MnP is the key enzyme in polyethylene degradation by lignin-degrading fungi.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular culture concentrates were prepared from Streptomyces viridosporus T7A, Streptomyces badius 252, and Streptomyces setonii 75Vi2 shake flask cultures. Ten-day-heat-treated (70$\,^{\circ}$C) starch-polyethylene degradable plastic films were incubated with shaking with active or inactive enzyme for 3 weeks (37C). Active enzyme illustrated changes in the films' Fourier transform infrared spectra, mechanical properties, and polyethylene molecular weight distributions. There is a growing interest in the development of degrad-able plastics to enhance biodegradability of plastic products in landfills and composts. One type of these novel materials consists of starch-polyethylene-prooxidant degradable plas-tics, which are used in the composting of lawn, garden, and shrub litter. Recently, Lee et al. (3) demonstrated the ability of lignocellulose-degrading Streptomyces badius 252, Strep-tomyces setonii 75Vi2, and Streptomyces viridosporus T7A to attack polyethylene in heat-treated degradable plastics in pure shake flask culture studies. In this paper, we describe the presence of an extracellular enzyme(s) produced by these bacteria that is capable of attacking and modifying the polyethylene portion of 10-day-heat-treated degradable plas-tics. S. badius 252, S. setonii 75Vi2, or S. viridosporus T7A was incubated separately in medium containing 0.6{\%} yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) medium (4) at 37$\,^{\circ}$C with shaking (125 rpm) for 48 to 72 h until the medium pH was .8.0. Cell mass was removed by filtration through glass wool, and the filtrate was concentrated threefold by dialysis against high-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol at 4$\,^{\circ}$C (6). The final volume of each bacterial culture concen-trate was then adjusted to 300 ml with deionized water and then divided in half. Inactive enzyme (control) was prepared by autoclaving three 50-ml samples in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks fitted with cotton plugs. The remaining 150 ml of culture concentrate was filter sterilized (0.45-,um-pore-size polycarbonate filter), 50 ml was dispensed into three sterile flasks, and then 1.3 ml of sterile antibiotic solution (5,000 U of penicillin, 5 mg of streptomycin, and 10 mg of neomycin per ml of a 0.9{\%} NaCl solution) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added.

	Abstract = {Lack of degradability and the closing of landfill sites as well as growing water and land pollution problems have led to concern about plastics. With the excessive use of plastics and increasing pressure being placed on capacities available for plastic waste disposal, the need for biodegradable plastics and biodegradation of plastic wastes has assumed increasing importance in the last few years. Awareness of the waste problem and its impact on the environment has awakened new interest in the area of degradable polymers. The interest in environmental issues is growing and there are increasing demands to develop material which do not burden the environment significantly. Biodegradation is necessary for water-soluble or water-immiscible polymers because they eventually enter streams which can neither be recycled nor incinerated. It is important to consider the microbial degradation of natural and synthetic polymers in order to understand what is necessary for biodegradation and the mechanisms involved. This requires understanding of the interactions between materials and microorganisms and the biochemical changes involved. Widespread studies on the biodegradation of plastics have been carried out in order to overcome the environmental problems associated with synthetic plastic waste. This paper reviews the current research on the biodegradation of biodegradable and also the conventional synthetic plastics and also use of various techniques for the analysis of degradation in vitro. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Biodegradable plastics (BPs) have attracted much attention since more than a decade because they can easily be degraded by microorganisms in the environment. The development of aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters has combined excellent mechanical properties with biodegradability and an ideal replacement for the conventional nondegradable thermoplastics. The microorganisms degrading these polyesters are widely distributed in various environments. Although various aliphatic, aromatic, and aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester-degrading microorganisms and their enzymes have been studied and characterized, there are still many groups of microorganisms and enzymes with varying properties awaiting various applications. In this review, we have reported some new microorganisms and their enzymes which could degrade various aliphatic, aromatic, as well as aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters like poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene succinate)-co-(butylene adipate) (PBSA), poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and poly(3-hydoxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalterate) (PHB/PHBV), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), poly(butylene succinate-co-terephthalate) (PBST), and poly(butylene succinate/terephthalate/isophthalate)-co-(lactate) (PBSTIL). The mechanism of degradation of aliphatic as well as aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters has also been discussed. The degradation ability of microorganisms against various polyesters might be useful for the treatment and recycling of biodegradable wastes or bioremediation of the polyester-contaminated environments.},

Yet in the research reported here, we showed that Arabic speakers tend to conceptualize the future as behind and the past as ahead of them, despite using spoken metaphors that suggest the opposite. We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

	Abstract = {Bacteria are widespread in nature as they can adapt to any extreme environmental conditions and perform various physiological activities. Marine environments are one of the most adverse environments owing to their varying nature of temperature, pH, salinity, sea surface temperature, currents, precipitation regimes and wind patterns. Due to the constant variation of environmental conditions, the microorganisms present in that environment are more suitably adapted to the adverse conditions, hence, possessing complex characteristic features of adaptation. Therefore, the bacteria isolated from the marine environments are supposed to be better utilized in bioremediation of heavy metals, hydrocarbon and many other recalcitrant compounds and xenobiotics through biofilm formation and production of extracellular polymeric substances. Many marine bacteria have been reported to have bioremediation potential. The advantage of using marine bacteria for bioremediation in situ is the direct use of organisms in any adverse conditions without any genetic manipulation. This review emphasizes the utilization of marine bacteria in the field of bioremediation and understanding the mechanism behind acquiring the characteristic feature of adaptive responses.},

	Abstract = {Industrialization and urbanization have led to massive accumulation of plastic garbage all over India. The persistence of plastic in soil and aquatic environ-ment has become ecological threat to the metropolitan city such as Bangalore, India. Present study investigates an ecofriendly, efficient and cost-effective approach for plastic waste management by the screening of novel microbial consortia which are capable of degrading plastic polymers. Plastic-contaminated soil and water samples were collected from six hot spots of urban and rural areas of Bangalore. The plastic-degrading bacteria were enriched, and degradation ability was determined by zone of clearance method. The percentage of poly-mer degradation was initially monitored by weight loss method, and the main isolates were characterized by standard microbiology protocols. These isolates were used to form microbial consortia, and the degradation efficiency of the consortia was compared with individ-ual isolate and known strains obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) and Gene Bank, India. One of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation was identified, and the biodegra-dation mechanism was hypothesized by bioinformatics studies. From this study, it is evident that the bacteria utilized the plastic polymer as a sole source of carbon and showed 20--50 {\%} weight reduction over a period of 120 days. The two main bacteria responsible for the degradation were microbiologically characterized to be Pseudomonas spp. These bacteria could grow optimally at 37 $\,^{\circ}$C in pH 9.0 and showed 35--40 {\%} of plastic weight reduction over 120 days. These isolates were showed better degradation ability than known strains from MTCC. The current study further revealed that the microbial consortia formulated by combining Psuedomonas spp. showed 40 {\%} plastic weight reduc-tion over a period of 90 days. Further, extracellular lipase, one of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation, was identified. The computational docking studies suggested that polyethylene glycol and polysty-rene present in the plastics might have good interaction towards the microbial lipase with stable binding and interacting forces which probably could be one of the reasons for the degradative mechanisms.},

The bacterium was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the phylogenetic analysis indicated the strain MZA-75 belonged to genus Bacillus having maximum similarity with Bacillus subtilis strain JBE0016. The degradation of PU films by strain MZA-75 in mineral salt medium (MSM) was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). SEM revealed the appearance of widespread cracks on the surface. FTIR spectrum showed decrease in ester functional group. Increase in polydispersity index was observed in GPC, which indicates chain scission as a result of microbial treatment. CO2 evolution and cell growth increased when PU was used as carbon source in MSM in Sturm test. Increase in both cell associated and extracellular esterases was observed in the presence of PU indicated by p-Nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis assay. Analysis of cell free supernatant by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that 1,4-butanediol and adipic acid monomers were produced. Bacillus subtilis strain MZA-75 can degrade the soft segment of polyester polyurethane, unfortunately no information about the fate of hard segment could be obtained. Growth of strain MZA-75 in the presence of these metabolites indicated mineralization of ester hydrolysis products into CO2 and H2O.},

Marine animals are mostly affected through entanglement in and ingestion of plastic litter. Other less known threats include the use of plastic debris by "invader" species and the absorption of polychlorinated biphenyls from ingested plastics. Less conspicuous forms, such as plastic pellets and "scrubbers" are also hazardous.

Abstract: Biodegradation of polythene bags and plastic cups was analyzed after 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of incu-bation in the mangrove soil. The biodegradation of polythene bags was significantly higher (up to 4.21{\%} in 9 months) than that of plastic cups (up to 0.25{\%} in 9 months). Microbial counts in the degrading materials were recorded up to 79.67 x 10'' per gram for total heterotrophic bacteria, and up to 55.33 x 10{\^{}} per gram for fungi. The microbial species found associated with the degrading materials were identified as five Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria, and eight fungal species of Aspergillus. The species that were predominant were Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus (Gram +ve), Moraxella, and Pseudomonas (Gram -ve) and two species of fungi (Aspergillus glaucus and A. niger). Efficacy of the microbial species in degradation of plastics and polythene was analyzed in shaker cultures. Among the bacteria, Pseudomonas species degraded 20.54{\%} of polythene and 8.16{\%} of plastics in one-month period. Among the fungal species, Aspergillus glaucus degraded 28.80{\%} of polythene and 7.26{\%} of plastics in one-month period. This work reveals that the mangrove soil is a good source of microbes capable of degrading polythene and plastics.},
