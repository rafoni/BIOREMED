	Abstract = {Lignin, the most abundant aromatic biopolymer on Earth, is extremely recalcitrant to degradation. By linking to both hemicellulose and cellulose, it creates a barrier to any solutions or enzymes and prevents the penetration of lignocellulolytic enzymes into the interior lignocellulosic structure. Some basidiomycetes white-rot fungi are able to degrade lignin efficiently using a combination of extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, organic acids, mediators and accessory enzymes. This review describes ligninolytic enzyme families produced by these fungi that are involved in wood decay processes, their molecular structures, biochemical properties and the mechanisms of action which render them attractive candidates in biotechnological applications. These enzymes include phenol oxidase (laccase) and heme peroxidases [lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and versatile peroxidase (VP)]. Accessory enzymes such as H(2)O(2)-generating oxidases and degradation mechanisms of plant cell-wall components in a non-enzymatic manner by production of free hydroxyl radicals ({\textperiodcentered}OH) are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Wood is the main renewable material on Earth and is largely used as building material and in paper-pulp manufacturing. This review describes the composition of lignocellulosic materials, the different processes by which fungi are able to alter wood, including decay patterns caused by white, brown, and soft-rot fungi, and fungal staining of wood. The chemical, enzymatic, and molecular aspects of the fungal attack of lignin, which represents the key step in wood decay, are also discussed. Modern analytical techniques to investigate fungal degradation and modification of the lignin polymer are reviewed, as are the different oxidative enzymes (oxidoreductases) involved in lignin degradation. These include laccases, high redox potential ligninolytic peroxidases (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), and oxidases. Special emphasis is given to the reactions catalyzed, their synergistic action on lignin, and the structural bases for their unique catalytic properties. Broadening our knowledge of lignocellulose biodegradation processes should contribute to better control of wood-decaying fungi, as well as to the development of new biocatalysts of industrial interest based on these organisms and their enzymes.},

@misc{Crawford1980,
	Abstract = {The transformations of lignin that occur during its biodegradation are complex and incompletely understood. Certain fungi of the white-rot group, and possibly other fungi and bacteria, completely decompose lignin to carbon dioxide and water. Other fungi and bacteria apparently degrade lignin incompletely. Differences in lignin-degrading abilities observed for different organisms may result from differences in the completeness of their ligninolytic enzyme systems. Not all lignin components may be attacked by a particular organism. Alternatively, different organisms may differ in their basic mechanisms of attack on lignin. The basic pathways of lignin degradation have been elucidated only for certain representatives of the white-and brown-rot fungi. Although it is known that each of the principal structural components of lignin is attacked by other fungi and bacteria, the biochemistry of that attack has not been elucidated. Work with low molecular weight lignin models has provided only limited information on possible pathways of lignin degradation by microorganisms. There is little evidence to suggest a correlation between abilities to degrade single-ring aromatic or lignin model compounds and the ability to degrade polymeric lignin. More evidence has come from analysis of spent culture media for lignin breakdown products and from comparative chemical analyses of sound lignins versus decayed lignin residues. Accumulated evidence with the most thoroughly studied white-rot fungi suggests that with these fungi lignin degradation proceeds by way of extracellular mixed-function oxygenases and dioxygenases, which catalyse demethylations, hydroxylations and ring-fission reactions within a largely intact polymer, concomitant with some release of low molecular weight lignin fragments. There are also apparent relationships between lignin, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism for some organisms, but the relationships may vary from one organism to another. Although research is now mostly at a basic level, industrial applications may result from lignin degradation research. Considerable potential exists for the development of bioconversions which might produce low molecular weight chemicals from waste lignins, and thereby reduce our dependence on petroleum as a source of these chemicals. Alternatively, such bioconversions might produce chemically altered forms of polymeric lignin that may be valuable industrially. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

@article{Iiyoshi1998,
	Abstract = {Degradation of high-molecular-weight polyethy- lene membrane by lignin-degrading fungi, IZU-154, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Trarnetes versicolor, was investigated under various nutritional conditions. IZU-154 showed the most significant polyethylene degradation among the three lignin-degrading fungi under nitrogen- or carbon-limited culture conditions. Furthermore, for T. versicolor and P. chrysosporium, the addition of Mn(II) into nitrogen- or carbon-limited culture medium enhanced polyethylene degradation. These results suggest that polyethylene degradation is related to ligninolytic activity of lignin-degrading fungi. Treatment of polyethylene mem- brane with partially purified manganese peroxidase (MnP) caused significant degradation in the presence of Tween 80, Mn(II), and Mn(III) chelator. This result demonstrates that MnP is the key enzyme in polyethylene degradation by lignin-degrading fungi.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular culture concentrates were prepared from Streptomyces viridosporus T7A, Streptomyces badius 252, and Streptomyces setonii 75Vi2 shake flask cultures. Ten-day-heat-treated (70$\,^{\circ}$C) starch-polyethylene degradable plastic films were incubated with shaking with active or inactive enzyme for 3 weeks (37C). Active enzyme illustrated changes in the films' Fourier transform infrared spectra, mechanical properties, and polyethylene molecular weight distributions. There is a growing interest in the development of degrad-able plastics to enhance biodegradability of plastic products in landfills and composts. One type of these novel materials consists of starch-polyethylene-prooxidant degradable plas-tics, which are used in the composting of lawn, garden, and shrub litter. Recently, Lee et al. (3) demonstrated the ability of lignocellulose-degrading Streptomyces badius 252, Strep-tomyces setonii 75Vi2, and Streptomyces viridosporus T7A to attack polyethylene in heat-treated degradable plastics in pure shake flask culture studies. In this paper, we describe the presence of an extracellular enzyme(s) produced by these bacteria that is capable of attacking and modifying the polyethylene portion of 10-day-heat-treated degradable plas-tics. S. badius 252, S. setonii 75Vi2, or S. viridosporus T7A was incubated separately in medium containing 0.6{\%} yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) medium (4) at 37$\,^{\circ}$C with shaking (125 rpm) for 48 to 72 h until the medium pH was .8.0. Cell mass was removed by filtration through glass wool, and the filtrate was concentrated threefold by dialysis against high-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol at 4$\,^{\circ}$C (6). The final volume of each bacterial culture concen-trate was then adjusted to 300 ml with deionized water and then divided in half. Inactive enzyme (control) was prepared by autoclaving three 50-ml samples in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks fitted with cotton plugs. The remaining 150 ml of culture concentrate was filter sterilized (0.45-,um-pore-size polycarbonate filter), 50 ml was dispensed into three sterile flasks, and then 1.3 ml of sterile antibiotic solution (5,000 U of penicillin, 5 mg of streptomycin, and 10 mg of neomycin per ml of a 0.9{\%} NaCl solution) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added. The 6{\%} starch-polyethylene-prooxidant degradable plas-tic was prepared commercially with POLYCLEAN},

	Abstract = {Lack of degradability and the closing of landfill sites as well as growing water and land pollution problems have led to concern about plastics. With the excessive use of plastics and increasing pressure being placed on capacities available for plastic waste disposal, the need for biodegradable plastics and biodegradation of plastic wastes has assumed increasing importance in the last few years. Awareness of the waste problem and its impact on the environment has awakened new interest in the area of degradable polymers. The interest in environmental issues is growing and there are increasing demands to develop material which do not burden the environment significantly. Biodegradation is necessary for water-soluble or water-immiscible polymers because they eventually enter streams which can neither be recycled nor incinerated. It is important to consider the microbial degradation of natural and synthetic polymers in order to understand what is necessary for biodegradation and the mechanisms involved. This requires understanding of the interactions between materials and microorganisms and the biochemical changes involved. Widespread studies on the biodegradation of plastics have been carried out in order to overcome the environmental problems associated with synthetic plastic waste. This paper reviews the current research on the biodegradation of biodegradable and also the conventional synthetic plastics and also use of various techniques for the analysis of degradation in vitro. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Biodegradable plastics (BPs) have attracted much attention since more than a decade because they can easily be degraded by microorganisms in the environment. The development of aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters has combined excellent mechanical properties with biodegradability and an ideal replacement for the conventional nondegradable thermoplastics. The microorganisms degrading these polyesters are widely distributed in various environments. Although various aliphatic, aromatic, and aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester-degrading microorganisms and their enzymes have been studied and characterized, there are still many groups of microorganisms and enzymes with varying properties awaiting various applications. In this review, we have reported some new microorganisms and their enzymes which could degrade various aliphatic, aromatic, as well as aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters like poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene succinate)-co-(butylene adipate) (PBSA), poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and poly(3-hydoxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalterate) (PHB/PHBV), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), poly(butylene succinate-co-terephthalate) (PBST), and poly(butylene succinate/terephthalate/isophthalate)-co-(lactate) (PBSTIL). The mechanism of degradation of aliphatic as well as aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters has also been discussed. The degradation ability of microorganisms against various polyesters might be useful for the treatment and recycling of biodegradable wastes or bioremediation of the polyester-contaminated environments.},

	Abstract = {In Arabic, as in many languages, the future is ``ahead'' and the past is ``behind.'' Yet in the research reported here, we showed that Arabic speakers tend to conceptualize the future as behind and the past as ahead of them, despite using spoken metaphors that suggest the opposite. We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

	Abstract = {Bacteria are widespread in nature as they can adapt to any extreme environmental conditions and perform various physiological activities. Marine environments are one of the most adverse environments owing to their varying nature of temperature, pH, salinity, sea surface temperature, currents, precipitation regimes and wind patterns. Due to the constant variation of environmental conditions, the microorganisms present in that environment are more suitably adapted to the adverse conditions, hence, possessing complex characteristic features of adaptation. Therefore, the bacteria isolated from the marine environments are supposed to be better utilized in bioremediation of heavy metals, hydrocarbon and many other recalcitrant compounds and xenobiotics through biofilm formation and production of extracellular polymeric substances. Many marine bacteria have been reported to have bioremediation potential. The advantage of using marine bacteria for bioremediation in situ is the direct use of organisms in any adverse conditions without any genetic manipulation. This review emphasizes the utilization of marine bacteria in the field of bioremediation and understanding the mechanism behind acquiring the characteristic feature of adaptive responses.},

	Abstract = {Industrialization and urbanization have led to massive accumulation of plastic garbage all over India. The persistence of plastic in soil and aquatic environ-ment has become ecological threat to the metropolitan city such as Bangalore, India. Present study investigates an ecofriendly, efficient and cost-effective approach for plastic waste management by the screening of novel microbial consortia which are capable of degrading plastic polymers. Plastic-contaminated soil and water samples were collected from six hot spots of urban and rural areas of Bangalore. The plastic-degrading bacteria were enriched, and degradation ability was determined by zone of clearance method. The percentage of poly-mer degradation was initially monitored by weight loss method, and the main isolates were characterized by standard microbiology protocols. These isolates were used to form microbial consortia, and the degradation efficiency of the consortia was compared with individ-ual isolate and known strains obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) and Gene Bank, India. One of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation was identified, and the biodegra-dation mechanism was hypothesized by bioinformatics studies. From this study, it is evident that the bacteria utilized the plastic polymer as a sole source of carbon and showed 20--50 {\%} weight reduction over a period of 120 days. The two main bacteria responsible for the degradation were microbiologically characterized to be Pseudomonas spp. These bacteria could grow optimally at 37 $\,^{\circ}$C in pH 9.0 and showed 35--40 {\%} of plastic weight reduction over 120 days. These isolates were showed better degradation ability than known strains from MTCC. The current study further revealed that the microbial consortia formulated by combining Psuedomonas spp. showed 40 {\%} plastic weight reduc-tion over a period of 90 days. Further, extracellular lipase, one of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation, was identified. The computational docking studies suggested that polyethylene glycol and polysty-rene present in the plastics might have good interaction towards the microbial lipase with stable binding and interacting forces which probably could be one of the reasons for the degradative mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {A polyurethane (PU) degrading bacterial strain MZA-75 was isolated from soil through enrichment technique. The bacterium was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the phylogenetic analysis indicated the strain MZA-75 belonged to genus Bacillus having maximum similarity with Bacillus subtilis strain JBE0016. The degradation of PU films by strain MZA-75 in mineral salt medium (MSM) was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). SEM revealed the appearance of widespread cracks on the surface. FTIR spectrum showed decrease in ester functional group. Increase in polydispersity index was observed in GPC, which indicates chain scission as a result of microbial treatment. CO2 evolution and cell growth increased when PU was used as carbon source in MSM in Sturm test. Increase in both cell associated and extracellular esterases was observed in the presence of PU indicated by p-Nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis assay. Analysis of cell free supernatant by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that 1,4-butanediol and adipic acid monomers were produced. Bacillus subtilis strain MZA-75 can degrade the soft segment of polyester polyurethane, unfortunately no information about the fate of hard segment could be obtained. Growth of strain MZA-75 in the presence of these metabolites indicated mineralization of ester hydrolysis products into CO2 and H2O.},

A large number of marine species is known to be harmed and/or killed by plastic debris, which could jeopardize their survival, especially since many are already endangered by other forms of anthropogenic activities. Marine animals are mostly affected through entanglement in and ingestion of plastic litter. Other less known threats include the use of plastic debris by "invader" species and the absorption of polychlorinated biphenyls from ingested plastics. Less conspicuous forms, such as plastic pellets and "scrubbers" are also hazardous.

Abstract: Biodegradation of polythene bags and plastic cups was analyzed after 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of incu-bation in the mangrove soil. The biodegradation of polythene bags was significantly higher (up to 4.21{\%} in 9 months) than that of plastic cups (up to 0.25{\%} in 9 months). Microbial counts in the degrading materials were recorded up to 79.67 x 10'' per gram for total heterotrophic bacteria, and up to 55.33 x 10{\^{}} per gram for fungi. The microbial species found associated with the degrading materials were identified as five Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria, and eight fungal species of Aspergillus. The species that were predominant were Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus (Gram +ve), Moraxella, and Pseudomonas (Gram -ve) and two species of fungi (Aspergillus glaucus and A. niger). Efficacy of the microbial species in degradation of plastics and polythene was analyzed in shaker cultures. Among the bacteria, Pseudomonas species degraded 20.54{\%} of polythene and 8.16{\%} of plastics in one-month period. Among the fungal species, Aspergillus glaucus degraded 28.80{\%} of polythene and 7.26{\%} of plastics in one-month period. This work reveals that the mangrove soil is a good source of microbes capable of degrading polythene and plastics.},

	Abstract = {The use of polythene is increasing day by day and its degradation is becoming a great challenge. Annually about 500 billion to 1 trillion polythene carry bags are being consumed around the globe. Polythene is durable and needs up to 1000 years for natural degradation in the environment. In the present review, an attempt has been made to pool all the available literature on the biodegradation of polythene under the following objectives: (1) to highlight the level of polythene pollution; (2) to enlist the cost effective methods; (3) to pool the source of polythene degrading microbes; (4) to brief the mechanism of polythene degradation; (5) to highlight the methods used for the biodegradation of the polythene; (6) to discuss the assessment of polythene degradation by efficient microbes; (7) to enlist the products of polythene under degradation process; (8) to test the toxicity level of the products of the degraded polythene, and (9) to discuss the future aspects of polythene degradation.},

	Abstract = {This study determined the degradation of plastic materials by three different species of microorganisms under both laboratory and field conditions using standard techniques. Results obtained revealed that Pseudomonas fluorescens was the most active of the tested microorganisms degrading approximately 18{\%} and 16{\%} of polythene at 9 and 12months period respectively and 3.8{\%} of plastics in twelve month period under field condition. Also, 8.06 and 5.63{\%} of polythene and plastics were respectively degraded in a month under laboratory condition. The biodegradation of the polythene material was relatively faster and earlier than that of the plastics with the polythene degrading for up to 12.94, 16 and 15{\%} at 9 months of analysis while only 2, 3.8 and 4.8{\%} of the plastic materials were degraded at 12month Kfor each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Aspergillus niger respectively. It can thus be concluded based on our research findings that the studied microorganisms posseses biodegradability properties to varying degrees of efficiency.},
